# 1. Project Status
Deadline: 5th August 2021

The project is currently underway. The first mentor meeting is booked on the 04/07/2021.


# 2. User Story
## 2.1 The business case (Project Goals):
A BMW representitive approached me asking for a fun mini game in order to celebrate BMW cars and improve knowledge of the models available.

The overall story would be as follows:
* The user will navigate to the website
* The user will be able to view the instructions and understand how the game works
* The user will be able to play the game
* The user will be able to submit their score

## 2.2 Wireframes

### Sitemap



### Mobile Wireframes



## 2.3 Website Objectives:
* The user must have fun
* The BMW brand should be well represented
* The user should learn more about the vehicles available to them


## 2.4 Design Inspiration

General

The general color theme of the game tries to mirror the theme in the below links. It uses a mostly white theme with elements of grey.

https://www.bmw.co.uk/en/index.html



# 3. Features

* The website will have a memory game
* It will have a button that will show and hide game instructions
* It will have a start button to hide content that isnt needed during the game
* It will have a reset game button with the option to remove numbers if they were selected and reset the game tiles
* It will have a numbers button which will replace the BMW Logo with black circles with white numbers. This should make it easier for the user in the mobile version
* The website will have a contact page with a form that will send an email to my account
* The website will have links to official BMW pages and content
* The more page will have embedded videos from BMW YouTube.

HTML 5 - https://html.com/html5/

CSS3 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS

Javascript - https://www.javascript.com/

Balsamiq Wireframes - https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/

JavaScript code beutifier - https://beautifier.io/ - Corrects javascript code with correct spacing/lines etc.

# 4. Testing
## 4.1 Informal Development Testing
Informal testing is and was conducted throughout the build. 

My method of testing is based on trial and error, something that I learnt through my time with VBA for MSOffice. I would write a line of code and check the outcome. Mostly working step by step.

The informal process of testing is as follows:
* Before code is written a new preview is opened
* Line/lines of code written
* Preview is opened and refreshed
* Desired outcome is checked
* Outcome is checked in a mobile phone layout using Chrome developer tools.
* If outcome is successful then wider checks on other code are conducted. For example, what impact does it have on other elements.
* If outcome is unsuccessful then the line/lines of code written will be checked and informal testing repeated.

Further testing including sending the website link to my partner who navigated the website on both her phone and tablet. This was useful as it flagged an
issue where pictures were not appearing on the home page.

## 4.2 Formal Deployment Testing
### 4.2.1 External website testing

In order to ensure that my code is correct I used the following website to flag issues with my code.

https://validator.w3.org/ - HTML validator. Looks specifically for errors in my HTML code.

https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - CSS validator. Looks specifically for errors in my CSS code.

### 4.2.4 Spelling

I have included a specific section for spelling. My dyslexia can make this part particularly troublesome. In order to ensure that my spelling is correct I have taken each page and put it into word to spell check. I then manually correct the page in GitPod.

### 4.2.5 User testing and feedback

## 4.3 Bugs

* When the numbers JS was added a bug when a certain combination of buttons pressed would result in black circles with no numbers
* 

# 5. Deployment
The website will be deployed using GitHubs built in pages' manager.

Step 1 - Log in to GitHub page

Step 2 - Navigate to project and click settings

Step 3 - In the bar on the left click pages

Step 4 - Under the source dropdown select main and click save

A link should appear above the source dropdown and look something like this

Your site is ready to be published at https://antony-thornton.github.io/MS2---Memory-Game/


# 6. Credits
## Content
Where needed source material is referenced below but also in the HTML page itself using comments. I have done it this way so that the referenced material can be easy to find within the code.
